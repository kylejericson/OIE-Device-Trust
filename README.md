Setup Okta OIE-Device-Trust without re-enrolling into Jamf Pro

While setting up the new OIE Device Trust with Okta, Jamf support said that the user needs to be MDM enabled. Since the end-user was created via Jamf Connect the only way to make this happen is to un-enroll and re-enroll. 

This workflow is to address this and make it possible without re-enrolling the device into Jamf.
