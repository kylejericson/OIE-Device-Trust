# OIE-Device-Trust
Setup Okta OIE-Device-Trust without re-enrolling into your MDM

While setting up the new OIE Device Trust with Okta, Jamf support said that the user needs to be MDM enabled. Since the end-user was created via Jamf Connect the only way to make this happe is to un-enroll and re-enroll. 
This workflow is to address this and make it possiable without re-enrolling the device into Jamf.
